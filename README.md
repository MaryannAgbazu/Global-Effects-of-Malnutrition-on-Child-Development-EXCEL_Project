# Global-Effects-of-Malnutrition-on-Child-Development-EXCEL_Project
##### An analytical probe into UNICEF data to ascertain the effect of malnutrition on child development globally
## INTRODUCTION TO MALNUTRITION
 Malnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, an imbalance of essential nutrients, or impaired nutrient utilization. It can manifest in various ways, affecting the body’s tissues and overall health
## OBJECTIVES
•	To know the global effect of malnutrition on child development

•	Aiming to address and representing the areas widely affected by child’s malnutrition

•	To understand malnutrition rate documented by UNICEF AND WHO

## EPIDEMOLOGY
•	Close to 50 million children younger than 5 years have PEM

•	Approximately 80% of these malnourished children live in Asia, 15% in Africa, and 5% in Latin America. MORTALITY/MORBIDITY

•	5 million children younger than 5 years die every year of malnutrition.

•	 70 million present with wasting, and 230 million present with some stunting

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Prioritize Early Intervention Programs in High-Risk Regions:
   
   **Dashboard Insight**: The dashboard highlights a concerning trend in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia, 
where the percentage of children affected by malnutrition remains persistently high.

   **Recommendation**: Develop and scale-up early intervention programs in these regions, focusing on the 
critical first 1,000 days of a child's life. This can involve promoting breastfeeding practices, providing 
micronutrient supplements to pregnant mothers, and offering nutritional education to caregivers.

2. Integrate School Feeding Programs with Locally Sourced Produce:
   
   **Dashboard Insight**: The UNICEF data suggests a correlation between poverty and malnutrition rates.

   **Recommendation**: Implement school feeding programs that provide nutritious meals to children in low income communities. Encourage partnerships with local farmers to source fresh produce, promoting food 
security and economic development within these regions.

3. Leverage Technology to Bridge the Knowledge Gap:
Develop culturally appropriate mobile phone apps or SMS campaigns that deliver essential information on 
child nutrition in local languages. Partner with local NGOs to disseminate information effectively in under resourced communities.

4. Invest in Training for Community Health Workers with a Focus on Maternal Health:
Train and equip community health workers to provide essential prenatal care, including nutritional 
counseling and access to micronutrient supplements. This can significantly reduce malnutrition rates in 
children by ensuring mothers have the resources for healthy pregnancies.

5. Encourage Data-Driven Policy Development at the National Level:
   
   **Dashboard Insight:** The UNICEF dataset provides a valuable resource for identifying specific countries and 
regions with the most significant challenges.

   **Recommendation:** Develop national policies based on data insights from the UNICEF dashboard and similar 
resources. This targeted approach can ensure interventions are tailored to address the specific needs of each 
region, maximizing impact.

6. Promote Sustainable Food Systems and Diversify Diets:
Support initiatives that promote sustainable agriculture and local food production. Encourage diversification 
of crops beyond staple grains to include fruits, vegetables, and legumes. This can improve access to essential 
vitamins and minerals, tackling micronutrient deficiencies that contribute to malnutrition.

7. Address Gender Disparities in Food Security:
Develop programs that empower women in agriculture and food production. This can involve providing 
access to land ownership, training in sustainable farming practices, and opportunities to participate in local 
markets. Improved food security within families can significantly improve children's nutrition, especially for 
girls.

8. Advocate for Trade Policies that Prioritize Child Nutrition:
Advocate for international trade policies that prioritize the import and export of nutritious foods essential for 
child development. This can help ensure vulnerable populations in developing countries have access to 
affordable, high-quality food sources.

9. Promote international cooperation:
Encourage international cooperation to address malnutrition: Malnutrition is a global problem that requires a 
global solution. Support international organizations that are working to address this issue.
